### What now?

Well you probably came here with the idea of sending messages to Slack from within your project?
You can find a simple example of it in the usage documentation below. First you need to get the bundle installed of
course, so check out the installation documentation first.

- [Installation](Resources/doc/installation.md)
- [Usage examples](Resources/doc/usage.md)
- [Commands for the Symfony Console](Resources/doc/api-commands.md)

Since most of this bundle relies on the [CLSlack library]((https://github.com/cleentfaar/CLSlack)),
the more  detailed documentation can be found in it's own repository [here](https://github.com/cleentfaar/CLSlack).

Additionally, check out the [API documentation](https://api.slack.com/) of Slack itself to get a
better picture of what happens in the background. You'll be happy to know that everything in the bundle and library are
named and configured the same as the official API so that you can use the official documentation during integration
of this bundle, if you wish to do so.
