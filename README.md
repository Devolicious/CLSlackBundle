[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/cleentfaar/CLSlackBundle/v/stable.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/cleentfaar/CLSlackBundle)

### What now?

The documentation for this bundle is available in the `Resources/doc` directory of the bundle:

* Read the [CLSlackBundle documentation](https://github.com/cleentfaar/CLSlackBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/index.md)

This bundle's main job is to integrate Symfony's command-line approach with the webhooks API provided by Slack.

Currently, the only command available allows you to post your own payloads to Slack.
There is also a command that shows you how to use it for specific scenarios such as the ``NotifyDeploymentCommand``.
Have a look at it and see how you could easily add your own variations to do other things.

You can learn a lot more about Slack and it's webhooks by reading the instructions on their website: https://yourusernamehere.slack.com/services/new
