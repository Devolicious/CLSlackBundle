CLSlackBundle
=============

The **CLSlackBundle** integrates the CLSlack library into your Symfony Framework project.
It lets you interact with the Slack API and webhooks through easy to use services and commands.

Since most of this bundle relies on the library, documentation about the fundamental code can be found in it's own
repository [here](https://github.com/cleentfaar/CLSlack).
