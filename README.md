Currently, the only command available allows you to post your own payloads to Slack.
There is also a command that shows you how to use it for specific scenarios such as the ``NotifyDeploymentCommand``.
Have a look at it and see how you could easily add your own variations to do other things.

You can learn a lot more about Slack and it's webhooks by reading the instructions on their website: https://yourusernamehere.slack.com/services/new
