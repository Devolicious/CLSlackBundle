Currently, the only interaction available is posting payloads to your Slack webhooks.
- You can either use the ``AbstractWebhookCommand`` as a base for your payloads or look at the ``NotifyDeploymentCommand``
that was already made to do just that. Have a look at it and see how you could easily add your own variations to do other things.
- You can learn a lot more about Slack and it's webhooks by reading the instructions on their website: https://yourusernamehere.slack.com/services/new
