# Console commands

The commands have been moved to a dedicated package: [SlackCli](https://github.com/cleentfaar/slack-cli).

## So now I have to pass the token for each command manually?

Don't worry, the commands are still smart enough to use the token you have configured in `app/config.yml`,
provided you have both packages installed.
